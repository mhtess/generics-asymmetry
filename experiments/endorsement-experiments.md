# Endorsement experiments 

## Endorsement 1 pilot

- 4/21/18
- micropilot 
- n = 18
- 18*0.75 = 13.5 + 2.7 = 16.2

## Experiment 1

- 25 properties (equally tiled along the continuum) x 5 prevalence levels = 125 items
- 50 ratings per item = 6,250 measurements
- each participants does 25 --> n = 250
- $0.75 --> 187.5 + 37.5 (20%) = $225
